# Summary

As a self-taught developer, I enjoy building applications on my own and solidify new concepts learned, as well as find new challenges to gain new insight and skills. Although this app is simple in design, I learned important JavaScript concepts, such as Event Delegation and how to create dynamic elmenets.
